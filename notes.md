notes from today:

I learned how to resolve conflicts: when having committed two different things to each file in both locations, a merging error will occur and you need to delete the delimiters that populate automatically to highlight the problem and then merge the two with the following command:
    git commit -am "notes(danny) made changes"
    then you can git push

git pull
    pulls changes from an edited repository to stay up to date
git push
    changes other cloned respository to have the same changes
