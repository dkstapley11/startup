        <p>
            Landmine Game is a game of chance, with an added twist. You stake your points at the start of each round! The goal is to
            uncover as many treasure chests as possible. Each time you uncover one, your staked points will double.
            You get to choose when to stop playing. The further you get, the more tempting it may be to keep doubling your points and get
            on that global leaderboard. But, get too greedy, and you may lose everything! You get to choose how many points you gamble. 
        </p>
        <h3>GOOD LUCK!</h3>
